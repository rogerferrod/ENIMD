# Pairing EU directives and their national implementing measures: A dataset for semantic search

<p align="justify">
European Directives (EUDs) are binding upon Member States as to the results to be achieved,
but leave to national authorities the choice of form and methods. Therefore, Member States
adopt ad hoc National Implementing Measures (NIMs) that mostly reproduce the contents
of EUDs and transpose them into domestic legislation. This well-known process is defined
as “legal harmonization” and consists of the gradual, although ambiguous, approximation
of national legal orders as a result of the adoption of European legislation. In order to 
contribute to the analysis of this phenomenon, we collect a large and unique dataset composed
of European and domestic legislative sources, which is an essential requirement to 
automatically pair EUDs and the corresponding NIMs, in light of their semantic similarity. The
first results show the feasibility of the proposed task to discern NIMs from national 
legislation that does not contribute to implementing EUDs, thus constituting the foundation for
a semantic search engine. We believe that our effort can promote future applications and
research directions, with the ultimate aim to support traditional legal methodology, 
facilitate citizens’ access to rights, support public administrations, and, more in general, promote
democracy and the rule of law in the European Union.
